## General

This skeleton use PHP-DI as dependency injection container, but you can use any
DI container with autowiring. Framework core uses only get and set methods
of ContainerInterface. But, in this case you need to edit this skeleton.
Also, this skeleton use Nyholm PSR http-message reslisation but you can use
any.

## Install
You can install le7 framework with composer
In current directory:
```
composer create-project rnr1721/le7-framework .
```
In some directory:
```
composer create-project rnr1721/le7-framework ./myle7framework
```

In any folder present README.md file, where you can find information about
engine functional.

## Web server configuration

### Apache

This is standard configuration of Apache web server
This file (.htaccess) already in public folder

```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /

# Route everything else to index.php
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^ index.php [QSA,L]

## Folder structure of project
```

### Nginx

Le7 engine may work on nginx fine, but I not testing it at this moment.
In the future, I will install this server and provide the configuration for nginx.

### Built-in PHP server for testing:

```bash
$ ./runserver.sh
```

### Workerman

I checked in workerman and it worked. But the problem is that I don't know how
to serve static files using workerman. But right now, as an API engine, itâ€™s
quite useable in Workerman

Running in workerman:

```bash
$ php ./workerman.php
```
